(1) Chrome doesn't support multiple styles on the same element, but old IE support it , fox example:
   <input type="text" id="pm_name"  class="edline" style="width:310;" readonly style="font-weight:bold"/>
   Chrome will miss the second style

(2) Grey or gray. Use one or the other, not a mix

	CSS spec 2.1 and recommendation 3 specify 'gray' only. 
	They do not directly specify light or dark varieties of this color.
	CSS3 extended keywords (read x11) spec both versions of the color and its varieties as the same.
	I.E. lightgrey = lightgray; darkgrey = dark gray; grey = gray.

    personally I would chose gray as it is CSS backwards compatible and is more correct as a core keyword rather than on extended keyword. 
    It also fits with the US-english used throughout the rest of the CSS specs and recommendations.
	the standard is in US-en

    I know this has come about because of previous inconsistent browser support, 
    but CSS2 and 3 do spec gray, and this is only the case with legacy browsers  
    
    this section comes from  https://github.com/CSSLint/csslint/issues/217
    
(3) use CSS override rather than use JavaScript or jQuery to hide and show multiple elements, for example:
	
	DivA
	    elementB
	    elementC classX
	    DivD
	    	elementE
	    	elementF classX 
    I want hide element C and F based on some JavaScript calculation
    we can hide them directly by JavaScript, or get them by classX, but they are not good
    
    the better way is using CSS override

    Div .classX{
    	display:block;
    }
    
    Div.hideCD .classX{
    	display:none;
    }
    
    
    This way, it has some benefits:
    	A. efficient, because they are hidden by browser CSS engine, so it is very quick when you want to hide tons of elements
    	B. maintainable, Developer can easily find what caused the hiding
    	C. can easily to combine multiple rules to hide and show elements.
    	
    This way doesn't work for readonly and disable because CSS has no way to control readonly and disable
