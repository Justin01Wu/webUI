(1) Chrome doesn't support multiple styles on the same element, but old IE support it , fox example:
   <input type="text" id="pm_name"  class="edline" style="width:310;" readonly style="font-weight:bold"/>
   Chrome will miss the second style

(2) Grey or gray. Use one or the other, not a mix

	CSS spec 2.1 and recommendation 3 specify 'gray' only. 
	They do not directly specify light or dark varieties of this color.
	CSS3 extended keywords (read x11) spec both versions of the color and its varieties as the same.
	I.E. lightgrey = lightgray; darkgrey = dark gray; grey = gray.

    personally I would chose gray as it is CSS backwards compatible and is more correct as a core keyword rather than on extended keyword. 
    It also fits with the US-english used throughout the rest of the CSS specs and recommendations.
	the standard is in US-en

    I know this has come about because of previous inconsistent browser support, 
    but CSS2 and 3 do spec gray, and this is only the case with legacy browsers
