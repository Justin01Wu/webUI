<h2>Demo how to get document mode (Only IE has document mode setting, so please open this page in IE)</h2>

<h3>your current document mode is 
<label id ="docMode" style="color:red;"></label>&nbsp;
 compatMode is <label id ="compatMode" style="color:red;"></label>
</h3>

<ul>
	<li> Compatibility View is the way IE try to implement backwards Compatibility 
   when newer IE version is transferring itself to W3C spec
   </li>

	<li> Compatibility View can't set by pages, it is controlled by the client or IT policy
	</li>
	
	<li> in Compatibility View (old IE) document.getElementById is case insensitive
but modern browser and new IE, it is case sensitive.
	</li>
	
	<li> Compatibility View is browser mode, not document mode. document mode is controlled by pages.
	</li>
	
	<li> child window which is opened by window.open can have different browser and document mode from base window
	</li>

	<li> parent doc and child doc in frames of frameset can have different doc mode <label style="color:red;">if parent doesn't have doc mode setting</label>, 
		but unfortunately in IE console you can only see parent doc mode
	</li>
	
	<li> child doc in iframes will have same doc mode of parent
	</li>
	
	<li> Compatibility View won't affect JavaScript directly, but it will change default doc mode which affect JavaScript  
	unless page it self set X-UA-Compatible
	</li>
</ul>
