<h1>Proverbs on software development</h1>

<ul>
<li>A function should do one thing and do it well</li>
<li>If an egg is broken by an outside force, life ends. If an egg is broken by an inside force, life begins.</li>
<li>There are 2 hard things in CS: “cache invalidation and naming things”.</li>
<li>Testability is a design issue and needs to be addressed with the design of the rest of the system</li>
<li>a testable system can evolve easily</li>
 


</ul>

<h2>refactoring</h2>
it comes from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/szafranek/javascript-refactoring" target=_blank>here</a>
<ul>
<li>Improving the design of code without changing its external behavior</li>
<li>Refactoring is not...If the changes affect external behavior, it’s rewriting, not refactoring.</li>
<li>continuous small steps: Refactoring should be done as a part of our every day workﬂow. Don’t wait for massive “big bang” refactorings.</li>
<li>Investment When to refactor? It’s an investment:- Makes change easier.- Helps ﬁnd bugs. But comes with time and effort cost.</li>
<li>makes code clear to other peopleNot machines</li>
<li>Martin Fowler“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.”
From the book “Refactoring”
</li>
<li>It’s much more important to write code that will be easy to understand by other peoplethan just understood by a browser.</li>
<li>clarity vs performance</li>
<li>clarity enables performance: Some of you have heard that “Premature optimization is the root of all evil”. Its easier to optimize clean code than to clean up "optimized" code.</li>
<li>CODE SMELLS</li>
<li>Code is like cheese.Some people ﬁnd smelly what other ﬁnd deliciously wonderful.</li>
<li>duplication: It makes change harder.The rule of 3: the third time you copy something, it’s time to refactor.</li>

</ul>
