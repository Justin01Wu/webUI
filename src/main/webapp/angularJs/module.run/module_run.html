	<h1> this is a demo of AngualrJs module run order</h1>
	
	<p><strong>Run blocks</strong> - get executed after the injector is created and are
		used to kickstart the
		application. Only instances and constants can be injected into run blocks. This is to prevent
		further system configuration during application run time.</p>
  
	<p>Run blocks are the closest thing in Angular to the main method. A run
	block is the code which needs to run to kickstart the application. It
	is executed after all of the service have been configured and the
	injector has been created. Run blocks typically contain code which is
	hard to unit-test, and for this reason should be declared in isolated
	modules, so that they can be ignored in the unit-tests.</p>
