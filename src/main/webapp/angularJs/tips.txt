Angular tips: 
            
(1) AngularJs directive name can't have upper case letter, 
      if you use Upper case letter, AngularJs(1.2.26) will ignore this directive without any warning.
      This will confuse you. But it support dot in the name, so you can use name like a.b 
      
(2) if the element is inside of ng-if , it won't trigger  $watch
  it will trigger $watch normally when inside of ng-show, so please replace ng-if with ng-show  if necessary    

(3) AngularJs directive properties name can't have upper case letter
