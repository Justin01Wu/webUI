it comes from https://github.com/cootetom/jQuery-JSON-Suggest-Search-Box

this is version 2 of jsonSuggest. 
It will replace version 1 of jsonSuggest, which can't work with jQuery 1.9 +

This version didn't maintain full css file, it borrow some css from jQuery UI, but customized it
so if you want to use it with real jQuery UI css, please do some css tunning.
