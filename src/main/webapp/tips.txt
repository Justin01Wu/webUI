(1) In Chrome (version 38 -40, didn't try others), the exception comes from JOSN.parse won't show up which line of JS code it comes from.
But IE and Firefox will show you which line of JS code
  
(2)  IE always cache AJAX response until you explicitly appending a query string parameter "_=[TIMESTAMP]"
 which means 	jQuery.ajax({cache: false, ... 
 other browser never cache  AJAX response
 
 (3) when a page has multiple frame in frame set, you need to choose correct frame in Chrome console to run command properly,
 it is a drop down list on the top of Chrome console

 (4) Chrome will send a error status 0 when browser cancelled a request
    (it often happens when user click a link to go to another page before an AJAX request return)
    So your code need to handle it if you are using jQuery:
     	jQuery.ajax({
    		url : ...,
    		dataType : 'json',
    		success : function(json) {
    			...
    		},
    		error: function(jqXHR,error, errorThrown) {
    			
    		    //If either of these are true, then it's not a true error and we don't care
    		    if (jqXHR.status === 0 || jqXHR.readyState === 0) {
    		    	console.error("browser canceled request: " + self.apiUrl );
    		        return;
    		    }
    			var msg = "loading all clients error with status: " + jqXHR.status;
    			console.error(msg);
                alert(msg);
            }

 (5) Eclipse always set JavaScript build path to src\main\webapp when import a maven project, 
     if your JavaScript is not there, you need manually add it 
     otherwise you will get this error when click the link of  a JavaScript function:     
       "the source is not on the include path of a JavaScript project"
