   general web development tips

(1) In Chrome (version 38 -40, didn't try others), the exception comes from JOSN.parse won't show up which line of JS code it comes from.
But IE and Firefox will show you which line of JS code
  
(2)  IE always cache AJAX response until you explicitly appending a query string parameter "_=[TIMESTAMP]"
 which means 	jQuery.ajax({cache: false, ... 
 other browser never cache  AJAX response
 
 (3) when a page has multiple frame in frame set, you need to choose correct frame in Chrome console to run command properly,
 it is a drop down list on the top of Chrome console

 (4) Chrome will send a error status 0 when browser cancelled a request
    (it often happens when user click a link to go to another page before an AJAX request return)
    So your code need to handle it if you are using jQuery:
     	jQuery.ajax({
    		url : ...,
    		dataType : 'json',
    		success : function(json) {
    			...
    		},
    		error: function(jqXHR,error, errorThrown) {
    			
    		    //If either of these are true, then it's not a true error and we don't care
    		    if (jqXHR.status === 0 || jqXHR.readyState === 0) {
    		    	console.error("browser canceled request: " + self.apiUrl );
    		        return;
    		    }
    			var msg = "loading all clients error with status: " + jqXHR.status;
    			console.error(msg);
                //alert(msg);  // this one will block JS execuation, so remove it
                jQuery("#userColumn").addClass("hasError");
            }

 (5) Eclipse (some version) always set JavaScript build path to src\main\webapp when import a maven project, 
     if your JavaScript is not there, you need manually add it 
     otherwise you will get this error when click the link of  a JavaScript function:     
       "the source is not on the include path of a JavaScript project"
       
     you can change it Project Explorer view, right-click the required project and select Properties | JavaScript | JavaScript Libraries.

(6)download behavior:

    <a href="/images/a.jpg" download>
    with download , chrome and FireFox are silently download,  but IE still open it in the page

    after set attachment, chrome and FireFox are still silently downloading, but IE ask "do you want to open or save..."
    for attachment, IE will automatically close window which is opened by target="_blank", but chrome and FireFox won't close it.

(7) console.log
    Basically IE browser doesn’t have console object if users didn’t open developer console.
    So any code are using console.log or warn will fail.

    To stop this , JavaScript code must have this dummy definition in the beginning:
    if (!window.console) {
           window.console = {
                 log : function() {},
                 warn : function() {},
                 error : function() {}
           };
    }

    by the way, some JS library has some kind of logging service, but none of them can be traced by browser: 
    In some browser, console.log will automatically write down which line of which file generate the log
    you can click on it to open related code
