But IE and Firefox will show you which line of JS code
  
(2)  IE always cache AJAX response until you explicitly appending a query string parameter "_=[TIMESTAMP]"

 (3) when a page has multiple frame in frame set, you need to choose correct frame in Chrome console to run command properly,
 it is a drop down list on the top of Chrome console
