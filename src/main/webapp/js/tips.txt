
(1) compare to JAVA, JavaScript doesn't match parameters of the function, so please use long function name if you comes from Java
		for example, you have 
		
			function abc(p1){...}
		then you can call it with this: 
		  	abc(p1, p2);		


(2)  compare to JAVA, JavaScript doesn't have private function, so please start function name with _ when you don't want somebody else to call

(3) To avoid global function, you can put a function inside another function, like
      
      function A(){
      	B();
      	
      	function B(){
      	}      
      }	
      
      now B is only available inside A
      
(4) json file can't have comments, but you can do something like this :
	{
  		"__description": "this is a mock up data",
	...
	}
