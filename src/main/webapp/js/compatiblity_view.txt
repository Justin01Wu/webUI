(1) Compatibility View is the way IE try to implement backwards Compatibility 
   when newer IE version is transferring itself to W3C spec

(2) Compatibility View can't set by pages, it is controlled by the client or IT policy

(3) in Compatibility View (old IE) document.getElementById is case insensitive
but modern browser and new IE, it is case sensitive.

(4) child window which is opened by window.open can have different View setting from base window


(5) Compatibility View is not document mode. document mode is controlled by pages.

(6) parent doc and child doc in frames can have different doc mode, 
    but unfortunately  in IE console you can only see parent doc mode
	
(7)	this.document will works in Compatibility View. 
   But in standard view you have to use window.document, this means current object, not window
