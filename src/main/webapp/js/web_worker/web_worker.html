	<h1>Web worker example</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>workers run in another global context that is different from the current</li>
		<li>Workers can spawn another worker</li>
		<li>Workers can NOT access DOM</li>
		<li>workers code must be hosted within the same origin of the parent page</li>		
		<li>workers can use importScripts() to share functions with others, but remember rule 1, it is in another context</li>
		<li>workers can only use message to talk with main thread</li>
		<li>importScripts() can add multiple files, they may be downloaded in any order, but will be executed in the order in which you pass the filenames into importScripts() . This is done synchronously;</li> 
		<li>importScripts() does not return until all the scripts have been loaded and executed.</li>
		<li>importScripts() use relative path to current js file,importScripts(relativeToCurrentJs), rather than to general document(new worker(relativePathToDoc))</li>
	</ul>
