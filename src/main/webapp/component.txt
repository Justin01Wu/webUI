As an Web UI component, it must have encapsulation:
    it handle all its own event, 
	it won't leak its event out
	external event can't affect it 
	container can only affect it by the interface
	it know how to handle its own data: retrieve data, save data 
	it know how to hide and show its own HTML element
	it still use global CSS style, but may have its own CSS style 
	it detects and adopt the environment, like which browser version, if a feature is supported
	it can find all its resources by itself
	
it nice have:
    support extension
    support dependency management
    can reuse and depend on other components
    communicate with other components
